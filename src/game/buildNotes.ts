// ====================================================================
// BUILD NOTES — what the running build says about itself.
//
// Two baked facts ride every build (system messages, Adam
// 2026-10-18):
//
//   BUILD_ID — the build's stamp: the minute it was built,
//   injected by vite.config.ts as a define (zero manual
//   steps; it changes on every build because the clock
//   does). The merge flow reads the stamp from the deployed
//   /build.txt (a static file the same config emits — a
//   bundle grep would NOT survive minification, which folds
//   the label away) and writes it into the system feed as
//   latestBuild, with the action level the update honestly
//   needs. A build that polls the feed and finds a NEWER
//   stamp knows it is the old build, and speaks at that
//   level.
//
//   BUILD_NOTES — this build's own release notes, in player
//   voice, spoiler-safe (the guide's discipline: tease,
//   never name a fate or an ending). The notes are part of
//   every landing's review surface, like all copy: whoever
//   composes a landing writes its lines here. A landing
//   that ships without notes gets the honest default below
//   — merges never block on missing notes.
//
// The new build greets with these notes on load ("While you
// were away — …") on the start screen's news seat and in
// the in-game system stream. Notes travel INSIDE the build,
// so a copy of the game anywhere (Workers site, itch,
// a portal) greets its own players correctly.
